/**

 * Per-LCU chroma reconstruction from the final CU tree and coefficients.
 *
 * After the search of an LCU, kvazaar's frame->rec chroma can differ from
 * what the decoder reconstructs for some 4:2:2 blocks (the search's recon can
 * read a stale work-tree reference or leave sub-TU areas without a residual).
 * This pass re-runs ONLY the chroma reconstruction in decode order, reading
 * references from the progressively-rebuilt frame->rec and using the final
 * quantized coefficients, so frame->rec chroma matches the decoder. Luma is
 * left untouched (it is already correct).

 * Rebuild one LCU's frame->rec chroma from the final CU tree and the final

 *
 * This is called at the end of the LCU's search (kvz_search_lcu), before the
 * worker's normal per-LCU deblock/SAO, so the filters operate on the
 * corrected chroma and no frame-level pass is needed. The search's own
 * per-candidate recon can leave stale pixels for some 4:2:2 blocks (rejected
 * candidates, sub-TU areas with no residual), so the chroma is re-built in
 * decode order.
 *
 * The references are taken from the search's work tree (search_lcu), whose
 * top_ref/left_ref were captured from the reference buffers (recdata_to_bufs)
 * before the worker's per-LCU deblocking - i.e. the pre-deblock pixels the
 * decoder uses for its intra prediction. They must not be re-copied from
 * frame->rec, which by this point contains the neighbours' post-deblock
 * pixels. The lcu->rec starts empty and is filled leaf by leaf in decode
 * order, so each block's intra references read either the LCU border refs or
 * the already-rebuilt reconstruction of its top/left neighbours.
 *
 * The coefficients must be COPIED: the recon-from-coeffs quantize path
 * dequantizes its coefficient buffer in place, and the search's final
 * coefficients are still needed for the bitstream coding (state->coeff).
